**about test cases**

- pay attention:  consideration about boundary conditions not sufficent

**about the thinking process**

- result-oriented!!!
  - try to find the steps( may be the data struct or  the method) that can reach the result.
  - then find the details of each step
  - all the step should be linked together 
  - finally write code

**about slice to map**

- alway stucked in a strange idea: put all elements of slice to map at first and then try to judge if  the element satisfy the condition.

- judge the condition at first, and then put the element into the map.Thus the result of the map is valuable.
